A Windows Forms C# .NET application that takes over the computer's mouse and screen. Harmless malware.\
The password to exit the malware is "exit". It's possible to use TAB and SPACE keys to uncheck "open at start" before inputting the password.\
I don't have the source code of the program anymore because of the old age of the program - I lost the source code. At least the .exe still works though.
